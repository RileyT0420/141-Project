                  <strong>Band Grading Policy:</strong>Although there are some standards all students must meet, it is our policy that students are graded on their improvement rather than a rigid set of standards. This mastery learning approach allows students of all talent and ability levels to be judged fairly, and according to their own efforts. As students’ progress through the various levels of the Band program, more effort is expected of them. Student grades in Band will be based on several different modes of assessment:
                  Concert/Contest Performance is both required and graded.
                  Playing Tests covering instrumental technique over assigned musical passages.
                  Exams covering musical terms and basic information
                  Quizzes/Assignments covering short passages or scales
                  Attitude/Participation will be evaluated by instructors on a weekly basis.
                  Concert Review of a College or Professional level instrumental performance each semester.
                  Bonus Points will be awarded toward Attitude/Participation grade in the following areas:
                  Extra-Curricular Participation (Marching, Pep, Jazz, Musical Pit)
                  Private Lessons (confirmation required)
                  Solo & Ensemble (additional entries beyond required)
                  Honor Bands/Camps/Clinics (confirmation required)
                  Outside Performances (confirmation required)
                  Concert Reviews (beyond 1 required)
                  Quarterly Grades will be computed based on total points earned in these areas:
                  Concert Performance
                  Playing Test(s)
                  Scales/Quizes/Assignments
                  Attitude and Participation
                  A=90% B=80% C=70% D=60% F= 50% or less
                  Exam Grades
                  A 100 point written exam or project will be administered during the Final Exam period each semester.
                  Semester Grades will be worth 20% of a semester grade

                  <strong>Harrison Band Behavior Standards:</strong>In any group of people there are rules in place that help to maintain order. We have a few simple rules that will help us to accomplish everything we need to do in band classes.
                  Follow directions the first time asked.
                  Keep hands, feet and objects to yourself.
                  No insults, name-calling or profanity.
                  Touch only equipment to which you are assigned.
                  Have all necessary equipment ready for rehearsal.
                  No food, drinks, candy or gum in the band room.
                  Cellular Phones, Earbuds, Laser Lights/Pointers, and other electronic devices 
                  1. Students are not to have laser lights or pointers at school. 
                  2. Students may use cellphones during a student's lunch period, passing periods, before, or after school. At all other times between 7:30am and 2:20pm these devices are to be turned off and placed out of sight when school is in session. Failure to comply with this policy will result in the following progressive disciplinary penalty and the item being confiscated and returned only to the parent or guardian. 
                  1st offense: Teacher choice 
                  2nd offense: Student will be sent to the office and an administrator will confiscate the device for the day. Teacher will make parent contact. 
                  3rd offense: Device confiscated by administration and parent/guardian must pick the device up from school. 
                  4th offense: Administration will schedule a meeting with student and parent/guardian to discuss a plan for student success. 
                  On the 5th offense and beyond, students may face consequences for insubordination and/or failure to comply. 
                  Students who refuse to turn over their cell phone or other electronic device to a staff member when asked are insubordinate and failing to comply with a request from a staff member. If the student refuses to turn over the cell phone or other electronic device to an administrator the result is up to five days of Out of School Suspension. Cell phones and other electronic devices are not the responsibility of the school. If stolen or lost, the student assumes the responsibility. 
                  Parent(s)/Guardian(s) allowing students to carry electronic devices to school implies permission to the school to have access to any and all information on the device if confiscated for disciplinary, or investigative purposes. Information contained on devices is subject to inspection. 
                  
                  Positive Consequences- Research has shown that it is much better to reward positive behavior when possible in order to bring about learning. We will use a number of positive consequences including: Praise, Positive Parent Contacts, and Opportunity to Participate in Extra-Curricular Bands, Opportunity to Participate in Band Trips, Awards.
                  Negative Consequences- Some behaviors are so detrimental to the class that they need to be addressed with negative consequences. These consequences are applied only when a student chooses not to follow the rules. The more the student makes negative choices, the higher the consequences. Some behaviors are so disruptive that they will lead to immediate removal from class with a discipline referral. Bullying and Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated and will be referred to the Administration for investigation.

                    <strong>Concert Review Assignment:</strong>The purpose of this assignment is for students to attend one of the many live musical performances in our community.

                    Concerts must be at a  level above where students currently play. Examples include: Professional, Semi-Professional and Collegiate Concert Bands, Jazz Bands, Orchestras, Small ensembles, or Soloists.  High School or Middle School Band Concerts are not appropriate.
                    
                    Concert must include their instrument  Please note that not every concert involves all instruments:  
                    Concert Bands will include everything. 
                    Jazz Bands feature Tp, Tbn, Saxes, Drum, Piano, Bass and Guitar. 
                    Orchestras typically do not include Saxophones or Euphonium/Baritone.  
                    Small Ensembles vary in instrumentation, check that the student’s instrument is represented.
                    
                    Students will complete this Concert Review  Form and  turn in a Program, Ticket Stub or email a Selfie taken at the concert with the stage in the background.
                    
                    All reviews must be submitted prior to the start of Final Exams.
                      
                    We are fortunate that many community organizations provide free and reduced cost student tickets for concerts:

                    <strong>Harrison High School Co/Extra Curricular Conflict Policy:</strong> On rare occasions there may be a conflict between an extra-curricular school sponsored sport or activity and a required event for the curricular band class.  Please be aware of the school policy #3 stated below.  In the event of a conflict between an extra-curricular band (jazz, marching, pep) and another extra-curricular, 1, 2 and 4 apply.  For extra-curricular activities such as Quiz Bowl, Academic Superbowl and Robotics be sure to check the State/National competition dates. Please contact the band office as soon as you are aware of a potential conflict. Every effort will be made to facilitate an equitable solution within school policy.
                    1.A regular competition takes precedence over a practice.
                    2.A tournament game takes precedence over a regular competition.  (A tournament is any series of competitions where a team, group, or individual moves from one level of competition to another.)
                    3.Co-curriculars (where class time has been spent preparing for the event) take precedence over extra-curriculars.
                    4.If all else is equal, the number of possible opportunities to participate will be considered. The activity with fewer participation opportunities will be given precedence.

                    <strong>Seating and Band Placement: </strong>Seating Placement in all bands is based on playing tests and attitude & participation in class. Periodic review and adjustments to seating may be necessary, and will be based on band class and sectional performance. All parts are necessary and important to the mature band sound.
                    All incoming 9th grade students are placed in Beginning (Freshman) Brass, Woodwind or Percussion Class for at least a semester, usually the full freshman year.
                    Concert Band Placement for Soph. Jr. and Sr. band members is based on musical ability (as assessed by playing tests, Honor Band selection and ISSMA Solo Contest results), work ethic, attitude, participation and the instrumentation needs of the ensembles. 
                    In most cases, students will progress from Beginning (Freshman) Concert Band to Intermediate Concert Band before being considered for Advanced Concert Band.  Students wishing to be considered for Advanced Concert Band:
                    Would consistently be seated near the top of their section  
                    Would likely be studying with a qualified private instructor on their instrument.
                    Would likely be performing G2 or G1 Solos at the ISSMA contest. Contest results are highly considered in decisions for advancement. 
                    The faculty reviews band placement every semester.

                    <strong>Private Lessons:</strong>Members of the Harrison Band program are highly encouraged to seek private instruction on their individual instrument. This is truly the best method for rapid advancement on any instrument. Students wishing to advance to the Chamber Winds should be studying their instrument at this level. Also, those students wishing to audition for All-State Band, or take Solos to contest at the Group 1 level should be taking lessons. Private lessons are available at a reasonable cost through a number of local teachers. The Children’s Music Foundation can provide lesson scholarships based on Free/Reduced Lunch status.

                    <strong>Purchasing an instrument:</strong>
                    Owning your own instrument allows you to continue and advance your musical journey. Now that you are in high school, you may wish to consider purchasing an upgraded instrument. There are several different options to purchase a step-up instrument.
                    Option 1 - Purchase or Rent to Own a quality new instrument 
                    We recommend  contacting our school music dealer, Quinlan & Fabish Music Co.  (Eastway Plaza-Lafayette) www.qandf.com  or another reputable full service dealer.  
                    These instruments have a warranty and after purchase support from the Music Retailer.
                    
                    Beware of Purchasing New Instrument “Internet Specials”  Please do not waste your money on these low quality instruments. Often a quality used instrument can be found for around the same price or a little more.  
                    These are cheaply made imports, often with vaguely Italian sounding names. 
                    They are often advertised as “Director Recommended” of “Professional”
                    They are often available in a variety of colors and come with gloves…
                    They are sold at clearly “too good not to be a scam” prices
                    They have playability and intonation problems which impair student progress.
                    They break easily and cannot be repaired due to inferior materials and lack of replacement parts
                    Most become unusable in less than a year 
                    
                    Option 2 - Purchase a quality used instrument 
                    Here is a process recommended by our school instrument Repair Tech Brent Laidler for finding a  decent used instrument on Ebay:
                    Ask your Band Director or Private Teacher for a specific Brand and Model of the instrument(s) they think will be appropriate and search for those.Don’t just search “Silver Trumpet” or “Wood Clarinet”
                    Once you look at the comparables and find an instrument at a price you are comfortable with, check out the seller.  Good Ratings?  Do they have full return/refund policies?  Do not buy if either of those are No.
                    Look at what else the Seller has listed. You want to buy from a band instrument reseller with some knowledge of instrument quality and condition. Not someone who has one used trombone and a lot of other garage sale junk.
                    Purchase a quality used instrument from a private party. 
                    Please check with Band Director for quality brand names and models
                    Used Instruments are often listed on FB Marketplace or Craigslist etc
                    Check “Instrument for Sale” notices in your band room .  
                    Ask the private party to meet at Brent’s Bench Instrument Repair in Lafayette and have Brent evaluate the instrument's condition prior to purchase.  
                    
                    
                    Final Word - Please be sure to check with the band directors, sectional instructor or your private teacher concerning name brands and models which can be trusted prior to purchasing any instrument.

                    <strong>Instrument Repair:</strong>We recommend that personal instruments needing repair be taken to:
                    Brent’s Bench Instrument Repair  
                   229 South 4th Street, Lafayette.

                   Brent Laidler is the contracted instrument technician for all TSC owned instruments, and he will be happy to help you with your personal instrument repair needs. 
                   
                   During the school year his public hours are weekdays from 11am to 6pm and 10am to 3pm on Saturdays. You can drop in with an instrument during those times without an appointment.
                   
                   The hours CHANGE in the summer due to a massive surge of school repairs during the summer break and the need for additional time to work uninterrupted during that time. During June, July and August they are open to the public on weekdays at 1pm and close at 6pm. Saturdays remain 10am to 3pm

                    <strong>Band Boosters</strong>The Harrison Band Boosters is a parent-run 501c3 charitable organization which plays a vital role in supporting all the Harrison Bands. They provide meals, uniforms, organize fundraisers, host events like the ISSMA solo/ensemble contest, support band trips, and much more. None of this would be possible without the dedication of the many parent volunteers who has given their
                    time to support these students.
                    
                    2024-2025  OFFICERS:
                    Co-Presidents: Diane Kelley &amp; Jackie Knotts
                    Co-Vice Presidents: Chris Peck &amp; Cara Wetzel
                    Treasurer: Kim Schoonmaker

                    Band Boosters are much more than the officers and committee heads. Their mission succeeds with all the parents who give of their time,in any amount,to support these student musicians. Let’s face it, everyone is busy, but even small contributions of time can make a big difference. Look for volunteer opportunities this year that fit your schedule. Your involvement truly enhances your child’s band experience, and the memories can last a lifetime.
